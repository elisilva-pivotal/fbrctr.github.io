# Rapid Prototyping

> How to use Fabricator to quickly build new views

Fabricator's [assembly engine](https://github.com/fbrctr/fabricator-assemble) is a powerful templating engine built on top of [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com). It helps you compose new materials and prototypical pages with very little friction.

## Layouts

Layouts are wrappers for pages. You can define as many layouts as you want by creating `.html` files in your layouts directory.

Example layout:

```markup
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>{{{decode "%7B%7Btitle%7D%7D"}}}</title>
</head>
<body>

    {{{decode "%7B%25%20body%20%25%7D"}}}

</body>
</html>
```

View content is inserted in the `{{{decode "%7B%25%20body%20%25%7D"}}}` placeholder.

Context can be passed from a view to the layout via front-matter.

The layout that a view uses is also defined in front-matter:

```yml
---
layout: custom-layout
title: My Custom Layout
---
```

This would use `src/views/layouts/custom-layout.html`.

When no `layout` property is defined, the view uses the `default` layout.

## Views

Views are unique pages templated using Handlebars. These are both Fabricator pages and user-created pages.

Example view:

```markup
---
title: Document Name
name: World
---

<h1>{{{decode "%7B%7Bhome.greeting%7D%7D%2C%20%7B%7Bname%7D%7D"}}}!</h1>

{{{decode "%7B%7B%3E%20button%7D%7D"}}}

```

This outputs a page that uses the default layout (since no layout was defined).

The front-matter block at the top provides context to both the layout and the view itself.

Context is also piped in from [data files](/building-a-toolkit/data.html). In this example, `{{{decode "%7B%7Bhome.greeting%7D%7D"}}}` refers to the `greeting` property in `home.json`.

Fabricator pages are typically stored at the root level of the `views` directory and user-created views (e.g. "templates", "pages", "interfaces") should be stored in subdirectories:

```
└── views
    ├── templates
    │	├── about.html
    │   └── home.html
    ├── components.html
    ├── docs.html
    ├── index.html
    └── structures.html
```

# Materials

> Defining the "materials" that make up your toolkit

"Material" is a generic term for the individual components/modules/chunks that make up an interface. By default, Fabricator defines a material taxonomy of "component" and  "structure", but is flexible and allows you to define your own taxonomy.

## Defining your taxonomy

A successful taxonomy takes into account a number of different factors such as established brand terminology, personal preference, the size and scale of the end applications, etc. Here are some sample taxonomies that might work for you:

```
└── materials
    ├── components
    └── structures
```

```
└── materials
    ├── atoms
    ├── molecules
    └── organism
```

```
└── materials
    ├── typography
    ├── elements
    └── components
```

```
└── materials
    ├── content
    ├── forms
    ├── lists
    └── navigation
```

Within the `src/materials` directory, you can define your taxonomy by organizing your materials into sub-directories.

## Adding materials

A material is a `.html` file that can contain [YAML](http://nodeca.github.io/js-yaml/) front-matter and handlebars markup.

To add a material, create a new `.html` file in the desired directory. The material should show up on the listing page automatically.

Every material is accessible as a handlebars partial using the `{{{decode "%7B%7B> partial-name%7D%7D"}}}` syntax where `partial-name` is the name of the file.

Sometimes it is useful to group materials, like instances where you want to show alternate versions. You can group materials by placing them in a subdirectory:

```
└── materials
    └── components
        └── lists
            ├── ordered.html
            └── unordered.html
```

Grouped materials are accessed as a partial using dot notation: `{{{decode "%7B%7B> lists.ordered%7D%7D"}}}`

## Documenting a material

You can directly associate documentation with a material by adding `notes` in the front-matter of the file:

```markup
---
notes: |
  These are notes written in `markdown`
---
<div class="component">My Component</div>
```

Notes will appear adjacent to a material on the listing page and can be toggled on/off.

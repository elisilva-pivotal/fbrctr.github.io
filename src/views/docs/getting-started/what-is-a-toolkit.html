# What is a "toolkit"?

> An introduction to toolkit-driven development

## Style guide vs toolkit

Website style guides have evolved over the years, starting as an outreach of the tradition (print) branding style guides, eventually maturing into great examples of how a brand should be look and feel on the web. [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.com/static/reference/styleguide/), [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/styleguide), [Salesforce](http://sfdc-styleguide.herokuapp.com/), [Code For America](http://style.codeforamerica.org), and [Google's Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/) have some of the best web style guides around.

A toolkit is more focused on *code* - specifically the modularity of website components. Toolkits break down websites into small, repeatable components, then use those components to build an infinite number of layouts. [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Topcoat](http://topcoat.io/topcoat/), and [Zurb's Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) are popular toolkits.

Both are great and can be extremely useful. Fabricator gives you a way to combine both concepts into one deliverable.

When you work with Fabricator, you develop a brand's look and feel on the web, while also producing a code toolkit that you'll use when building their digital properties.

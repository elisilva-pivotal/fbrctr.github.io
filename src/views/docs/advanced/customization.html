# Customization

> Make Fabricator look and feel like you want

## Themes

Fabricator comes with two themes: light (default) and dark.

Set the theme in the `src/assets/fabricator/styles/partials/_variables.scss` file:

```scss
$theme: $theme-dark;
```

### Colors

The colors for each theme can also be set in the `_variables.scss` file. The most important color is `$accent`. This is the color that is used to highlight active menu items and should be a color from your toolkit's palette.

## Menu

The order of items is the side menu can be changed to suite your needs. The `f-menu.html` partial is templated using data scraped from your toolkit files. By default it iterates through a hash of materials and views.

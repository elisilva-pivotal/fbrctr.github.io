# Third-party Dependencies

> Including third-party dependencies in your toolkit

Many times you'll want to include a third-party library like [jQuery](http://jquery.com) in your toolkit. It's fairly easy to do so, but requires some modification to the `gulpfile.js`.

## Using Bower for dependency management

[Bower](http://bower.io) is a great tool for managing third party client side dependencies. Here's how to leverage Bower on a Fabricator instance:

0. Install Bower globally for access to the CLI `$ npm install -g bower`
1. Install Bower local to project `$ npm install bower --save-dev`
2. Run `$ bower init` to initialize Bower for your project.
3. Add a `.bowerrc` config file to your project root. The `"directory"` property defines where dependencies are installed.

**.bowerrc**

```javascript
{
  "directory": "bower_components"
}
```

4. Update `package.json` `scripts` object to hook into Bower install task.

**package.json**

```javascript
"scripts": {
  "gulp": "gulp",
  "bower": "bower",
  "prestart": "npm install",
  "build": "npm install && gulp",
  "start": "gulp --dev",
  "postinstall": "bower install",
  "test": "npm run build"
},
```

5. Add `bower_components` to `.gitignore`.

6. Install dependencies with Bower.

```bash
$ bower install --save-dev jquery
```

## Including vendor scripts

Fabricator gives you a couple of options for building vendor files.

### Option 1: Include vendor files directly in toolkit.js

*This is the more portable option - it will produce a single `.js` file.*

Since Fabricator uses [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) for bundling, you have the option to include non-CommonJS scripts by using the `script!` [loader shim](https://github.com/webpack/script-loader).

```javascript
// vendor files
require('script!../../../../bower_components/path/to/file1');
require('script!../../../../bower_components/path/to/file2');

// rest of the toolkit.js
...
```

This will load the target files as if it were a normal concatenation.

If a file is written as CommonJS, you can treat it as a module:

```javascript
// with bower
var $ = require('../../../../bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery');

// or with npm
var $ = require('jquery');
```

### Option 2: Produce a separate vendor.js file

*Use this option if you want to keep separate `toolkit.js` and `vendor.js` files.*

Create a `vendor` property to the `config` object in `gulpfile.js` Add target files as an array:

```javascript
var config = {
	...
	src: {
		scripts: {
			fabricator: [
				...
			],
			vendor: [
				'bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery',
				'bower_components/some-jquery-plugin/plugin'
			],
			toolkit: './src/assets/toolkit/scripts/toolkit.js'
		},
		...
	},
	...
};
```

The `webpack.config.js` file is already setup to read a `config.src.vendor` array if it exists and will output a `vendor.js` file.

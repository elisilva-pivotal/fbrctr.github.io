# Error Handling

There are a couple of options for capturing errors encountered during the assembly of Fabricator view and partials.

## options.logErrors

Type: `Boolean`

Whether or not to log errors to console. If set to false, the app will exit on error.

By default, this value is set to `true` in dev mode and `false` in build mode. Generally, you should tolerate errors in development, but not when building for release.

```javascript
assemble({
	logErrors: true
});
```

## options.onError

Type: `Function`

Error handler function. Receives an error object param. Helpful if you want to customize your error handling.

```javascript
assemble({
	onError: function (err) {
		notify(err.message);
	}
});
